# pygame-pygbag-replit
A repl for programming a game in pyhton and the pygame package. The game is run clientside, by using pygbag. Why this repl? 1. Fixing performance problems of using pygame the traditional way in replit (serverside execution of python script and streaming grahics) 2. Static hosting of the game

# this isn't working
